This project was cretaed using flask as a server and react as a client. Server and client are using proxy module and CORS.

## Available Scripts

To run the project open two terminals and run `cd flask-backend` on one terminal and `cd client` on the other.

In the flask-backend directory terminal run:

### `flask run`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to view it in your browser.


In the client directory terminal run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


You are ready to go!


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
